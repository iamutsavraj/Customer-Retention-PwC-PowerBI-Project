# Customer_Retention_PwC_Project
Welcome to this Customer Retention Pwc Project repository.
I have completed this project during PwC Power BI Job Simulation on Forage.
In this project I have: Defined proper KPIs. Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.
Strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs,
showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
